The Error Interceptor intercepts http responses from the api to check if there were any errors.
 If there is a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden response the account is automatically logged out of the boilerplate application,
  all other errors are re-thrown up to the calling service so an alert with the error can be displayed on the screen.

It's implemented using the Angular HttpInterceptor interface included in the HttpClientModule,
 by implementing the HttpInterceptor interface you can create a custom interceptor to catch all error responses from the api in a single location.

Http interceptors are added to the request pipeline in the providers section of the app.module.ts file.
