The app initializer runs before the boilerplate app starts up and attempts to automatically
 authenticate the user in the background by calling accountService.refreshToken() to get a new JWT token from the api 
 using the refresh token stored in the browser cookie (if it exists).

If the user has logged in previously (without logging out)
 and the browser still contains a valid refresh token cookie 
 then they will be automatically logged in when the app loads.

The call to the .subscribe() method triggers the request to the api,
 and the .add() method is used for executing additional logic after the request completes (success or failure), 
 so it works like a promise finally() method.

The app initializer is added to angular app in the providers section of the app module using the APP_INITIALIZER injection token.
