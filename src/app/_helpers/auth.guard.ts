// The auth guard is an angular route guard that's used to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing restricted routes,
// it does this by implementing the CanActivate interface which allows the guard to decide if a route can be activated with the canActivate() method. 
// If the method returns true the route is activated (allowed to proceed), otherwise if the method returns false the route is blocked.
