In order to run and test the Angular boilerplate app without a real backend API, 
the example uses a fake backend that intercepts the HTTP requests from the Angular app and sends back "fake" responses.
 This is done by a class that implements the Angular HttpInterceptor interface, 
 for more information on Angular HTTP Interceptors see https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpInterceptor or this article.

The fake backend is organised into a top level handleRoute() function that checks the request url and method to determine how the request should be handled.
 For intercepted routes one of the below // route functions is called, for all other routes the request is passed through to the real backend by calling next.handle(request).
  Below the route functions there are // helper functions for returning different response types and performing small tasks.

The fake backend can't send emails so instead displays "email" messages on the screen by calling alertService.info()
with the contents of the email e.g. "verify email" and "reset password" emails.
