The account service handles communication between the Angular app and the backend api for everything related to accounts.
It contains methods for the login, logout and registration, as well as and standard CRUD methods for retrieving and modifying user data.

On successful login the returned user is stored in browser local storage to keep the user logged in between page refreshes and browser sessions,
 if you prefer not to use local storage you can simply remove it from the account service and the application will continue to work correctly,
  except for staying logged in between page refreshes.

The user property exposes an RxJS observable (Observable<User>) so any component can subscribe to be notified when a user logs in,
 logs out or updates their profile. The notification is triggered by the call to this.userSubject.next() from each of those methods.
For more info on component communication with RxJS see the tutorial Angular 10 - Communicating Between Components with Observable & Subject.

The userValue getter allows other components to easily get the current value of the logged in user without having to subscribe to the user observable.
